# mastersop_temperature

Arduino Temperature Control Project in Master Workshop. The scheme includes a 220V relay, which will be connected to a heater. Later, a solar collector is planned to be connected, with a second thermometer inside the collector. Forced air intake from the collector is started by a signal from the solar battery.

Components used:
Controller - Arduino mini
Digital thermometer - DS18B20

Files:
mastersop_temperature.ino - sketch for Arduino
mastersop_temperature.ino - project schematic for automated design system Proteus
mastersop_temperature.ino.hex - firmware file for Arduino emulator in Proteus.
